# AIwoniuche_Learning
My own study notes about artificial intelligence technology.


Firstly,I'm going to record and organize some kernels that I think are excellent in the Kaggle.
Secondly,I'm going to record a lot of notes about learning pytorch、tensorflow1.、tensorflow2.0 and keras.
Thirdly，I'm going to record a lot of code about time series.
